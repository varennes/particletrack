Diffusing particle simulation. Particles move randomly inside a 3D volume and boundaries can be periodic or absorbing. Flux boundaries can also be used in order to create concentration gradients across the volume.

Cells can be placed within the simulation volume. The number of particles within a cell can be counted in order to assing a cell a polarization vector.
